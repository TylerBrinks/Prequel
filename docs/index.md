# Prequel 
Prequel is a query engine capable of querying any data source using common SQL syntax.

---

This project was originally inspired by Apache Data Fusion.  The intent of this project is to demonstrate how query engines work while bringing a user-friendly SQL query engine to the .NET community

The code in this project uses the [SqlParser C# SQL grammar parser](https://github.com/TylerBrinks/SqlParser-cs) project to parse SQL statements and, in turn, transform the statements into a series of executable read operations against any number of backing data sources.  

This projectâ€™s documentation outlines every step involved in building a generic query engine.
